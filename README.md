# Stepper-Motor-Control
The goal in this case study is to provide an understanding of the issues and techniques for stepper motor control using an embedded microcomputer.

Motors are used for a variety of applications in mechatronic systems. Motors effectively apply
torques and forces to mechanical components initiating motion. Mechatronic systems which
involve the motion of mechanical components are often called motion control systems. Motion
control, in mechatronic terms, means to accurately control the movement of an object based upon
either speed, distance, load or a combination of all these factors. There are numerous types of
motors used for motion control systems, including: stepper motors, linear step motors, dc brush
motors, brushless motors, servo motors, brushless servo motors, linear servo motors, ac motors
and more. This case study involves stepper motor technology. Stepper motors are the preferred
technology for position control systems such as those in machine tools. They are also used, for
example, to control the opening of valves in chemical process control.
